S_dist back to working with macaque model. Had to change the .mosaic file back to the macaque. Was still using WTs mosaic file.

-shape full_field produces exponential like distribution of s cone responses in h2 nodes, but the ratio between the smallest and largest s responses is very small. The ratio is dependent upon spatial frequency. Higher SF values will exaggerate the effect.

Added macaque.sh to run all analyses.

Speed up photoreceptors to bring temporal frequency of horizontal cells more in line with what is known.

May need to play with speed of horizontal cells themselves (Gp).

The following produces a good cone input diagram:

./retina.sh -model WT cone_inputs -W 0.65 -H 0.04 -w 0.4 -t 0.85 -h 0.02 -p 1.0 -l 0.1 -m 0.1
